Every company I was applying for before was placing me at sales, I resisted.\nWhat am I doing now? Sales 😂😂😂 at my own company. Realize that other people may be able to see your strengths faster than you can. \n\n2. I worked too hard when my friends were partying. It's ok to work hard realize also that at middle aged you may no longer want to party so party now \n\n3. I worked too hard and didn't travel. Travel. Buy experiences. \n\n4. I studied so much too. This is just really habit now. I'm a polymath and really a life long learner when I no longer need to work I will still study cause I enjoy it. Nurture habits you can capitalize on in the future \n\n5. No one is better than you. There are no adults. Everyone is figuring it all out even me, even your parents. This will free you to follow your own rules and path for your life. \n\n6. Write what your dream job to be. If you dont need the money and you just want to help what is that area where you can help and enjoy helping people? For sure that dream job doesn't exist yet so write it and go towards that dream job everyday. \n\n7. There will always be uncertainties in life. How you deal with failures, obstacles, mistakes, shortcomings will be a part of your life's success. \n\n8. Everyone you meet can teach you something even the most difficult people you'll meet in life are angels in disguise tho they look like the devil in that moment 😂😂😂 don't label people good or bad, don't label your experiences. Good or bad, who knows 🤷🏽‍♀️ \n\n--- \n\nIf you enjoyed this and want to be a part of our team as one of our interns for sales and marketing.
